# MCP-Archive
An archive of ModCoderPack sources for Minecraft 1.0 - 1.7.9

# Help
Since most of the MCP sources used to be hosted on mediafire or ad.fly, there is a high chance that they been taken down years ago with no going back. Please help and contribute with archiving Minecraft for the future.

# Why?
In the past few months, it's been harder for me to find older sources of older Minecraft versions, so I have searched and found some sources left.
